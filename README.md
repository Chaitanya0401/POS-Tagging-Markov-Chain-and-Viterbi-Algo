# POS-Tagging-Markov-Chain-and-Viterbi-Algo

This is an assignment from the specialization of Natural Language processing offered by DeepLearning.ai. It shows how part of sentence can be tagged using Markov Chaoin and Viterbi Algorithm.

A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for obtaining the maximum a posteriori probability estimate of the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events, especially in the context of Markov information sources and hidden Markov models (HMM).
